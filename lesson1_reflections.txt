how did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug?

It was helpful because-
.it was very easy to spot the difference
.it took very less time
.the result of file comparision was in a structured format which made it much easier


how could having easy access to entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

because-
it will help to reference the old code.
it will help to find out any errors and debug the new versions easily
it will help us to track the evolution of the code from scratch.

what do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,like you do in Git,vs having versions automatically saved,like google docs does?

pros-
choosing manually will help to keep track of the reasons for commit and comment accordingly.
it will also be helpful for the other developers

cons-
it may cause eror from the programmer if he forgets to save.
it will also take long time forthe other developer to view the code

how do you want to use git?

git will be very useful to maintain the code clearly with the additional details required.
git will help to restore old code securely and help you explore the new functions without risking of breaking the existing code.
