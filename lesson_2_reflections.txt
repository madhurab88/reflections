what are the situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organised?how would branches help?

branches are helpful-

for experimenting new things on existing working code wothout breaking it
for adding multiple versions(different languages,diff syntax) of the same commit.

how do the diagrams help you visualise the branch staructure?
 diagrams always helps in better understanding and hence better understanding of the branching

what is the result of merging two branches together?why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

merging two different branches will result in combining the functionality of both the branches without breaking the code.representing it in a diagram gives the clear idea and understanding of the branches and its merges.
